Description:
Will stub out models and controllers needed for short message service. The first args is the model name for the message. The second is the model name for delivery receipt. Controller name will be the pluralized version of the given names. I recommend to use the default names short_message and delivery_receipt.
	
Examples:
  ./script/generate short_message_service short_message delivery_receipt
